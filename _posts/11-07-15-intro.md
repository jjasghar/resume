Hi! My name is Jonathan Asghar, but I go by JJ almost everywhere. On-line you'll find my handle is **jjasghar** almost everywhere apart from IRC ([freenode](http://freenode.net)) where I'm know as **j^2**. I'm presently *not looking for employment*, I'm extremely happy at Chef and greatly enjoy helping out the OpenStack community move forward with their technology stack. This site mainly is for a reference and place for myself to put things I have achieved in my career. For instance the "videos" link above, you'll see times I've discussed something or presented something to a crowd.

If you would like to see the code or day to day things I work on, please check out my main [Github profile](https://github.com/jjasghar) to get a taste of my coding skills.

I'm also the maintainer of the following projects:

- rabbitmq chef cookbook [source](https://github.com/jjasghar/rabbitmq), [supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/rabbitmq)
- knife-openstack [source](https://github.com/chef/knife-openstack), [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/knife-openstack)
- knife-maas [source](https://github.com/chef-partners/knife-maas), [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/knife-maas)

- [chef-book](https://github.com/jjasghar/chef-book)
- A few random lita-plugins

I have multiple code contributions all over the internet. If you would like to discuss any of those, don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:jjasghar@gmail.com) to me.
