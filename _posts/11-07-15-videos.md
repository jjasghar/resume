## Deploying OpenStack Sanely with Chef

I tell the story of the openstack-chef-repo and the mistakes I've made with it. This talk explains how the openstack-chef-repo was created, tested, verified, and failed. I introduce the openstack-model-t during this talk also. I did this talk at AutomaCon 2015, September 16.

Assuming you get just some key concepts down, you can now reliably build OpenStack with Chef. In the process of creating integration testing for the OpenStack+Chef project we needed to create an opinionated full stack build of the OpenStack core projects. In turn we created an automated way to build it via http://github.com/openstack/openstack.... This'll be the story of how we did it and how you can use it to leverage building your Openstack Cloud.

## Chef-DK Or How I Learned To Love Embedded Ruby

My first real talk at presented at DevOps Days Austin. I found myself talking to people about chef, and they still were using `gem install chef` which is considered no longer the best practice. This talk was extremely straight forward and informative which was the goal.

## Talking about Chef and MAAS integration

This was at the Vancouver OpenStack Summit, during the Ubuntu track. We had some technical issues around the OrangeBox that we were using so this was very adhoc. We talk about the [knife-maas](https://github.com/chef-partners/knife-maas) and briefly discuss [chef-provisioning-maas](https://github.com/chef-partners/chef-provisioning-maas) which has become one of the better demo [chef-provisioning](https://github.com/chef/chef-provisioning) drivers out there.
