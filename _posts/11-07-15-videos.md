# Talks and Videos I've presented

<br />

## Chef-DK Or How I Learned To Love Embedded Ruby

My first real talk at presented at DevOps Days Austin. I found myself talking to people about chef, and they still were using `gem install chef` which is considered no longer the best practice. This talk was extremely straight forward and informative which was the goal.

## Talking about Chef and MAAS integration

This was at the Vancouver OpenStack Summit, during the Ubuntu track. We had some technical issues around the OrangeBox that we were using so this was very adhoc. We talk about the [knife-maas](https://github.com/chef-partners/knife-maas) and briefly discuss [chef-provisioning-maas](https://github.com/chef-partners/chef-provisioning-maas) which has become one of the better demo [chef-provisioning](https://github.com/chef/chef-provisioning) drivers out there.
